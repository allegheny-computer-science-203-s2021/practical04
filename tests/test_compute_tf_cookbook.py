# TODO: Add your test cases from the previous practical assignment
#
# TODO: Calculate the coverage of your test suite
#
# TODO: Try to add test cases to increase the coverage of your test suite
#
# TODO: You should try to cover as many regions of the program as is possible
#
# Suggestions:
# -- Study the test coverage report and see what:
#   --> Lines
#   --> Blocks of lines
#   --> Branches
# are currently not being covered by the tests.
# Then, think about how you can create an input that will cause the tests
# to cover those regions of functions in the compute_tf_cookbook program.
#
# -- As you attempt to increase coverage, think carefully about
# how you can run the functions under test in a different way
#
# -- Don't forget that you cannot cover the lines in a function of the
# compute_tf_cookbook if you do not have a test that calls that function!
